  shortdescription: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
    centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
    Ipsum.
  description: But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
    of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
    truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
    know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
    extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
    to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
    pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
    right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
    pleasure?
