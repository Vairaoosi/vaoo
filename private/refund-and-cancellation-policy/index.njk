                    <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">At SHAMIE MUHINUDHEEN, we are committed to providing the best service to our customers, which is why we have established a clear and liberal cancellation policy. Please read the following guidelines for cancellations and refunds:</p>

                    <h5 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"><strong>1. Cancellation Policy</strong></h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. Once the order has been communicated to our vendors/merchants and the shipping process has been initiated, cancellation requests will not be entertained.</p></li>
                        <li><p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">We do not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, if the product delivered does not meet quality standards, we offer a refund or replacement upon verification.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"><strong>2. Damaged or Defective Items</strong></h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">If you receive damaged or defective items, please report it to our Customer Service team immediately. The request will be processed after the merchant reviews and confirms the issue on their end.</p></li>
                        <li><p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">Claims regarding damaged or defective items should be reported within the same day of receipt. Failure to report within this time frame may result in the issue being ineligible for a refund or replacement.</p></li>
                        <li><p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">If the product received does not match the description on the website or is not as per your expectations, kindly notify our Customer Service team within the same day of receiving the product.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"><strong>3. Warranty Products</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">For products that come with a warranty from the manufacturer, please contact the manufacturer directly for any warranty-related issues. In such cases, we will not be responsible for the warranty claims but will provide support where necessary.</p>

                    <h5 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"><strong>4. Refund Processing Time</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">If a refund is approved, the refund process may take between <strong>9-15 business days</strong> to be completed and reflected in your account, depending on the payment method used for the transaction.</p>

                    <h5 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"><strong>5. General Terms</strong></h5>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">SHAMIE MUHINUDHEEN reserves the right to refuse any cancellation request in cases where the terms outlined above are not met. We encourage our customers to read and review the products carefully before placing an order to ensure complete satisfaction.</p>

                    <p style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Cancellation & Refund Policy, please feel free to contact our Customer Service team for assistance.</p>
